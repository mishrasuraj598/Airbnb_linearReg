# Airbnb_linearReg
This project is a linear regression model built on Seattle properties data to predict price based on features of the property

The data is procured from Kaggle and can be downloaded from the below link
https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

The datasets are 3 csv files
1. Listings is a dataset which has a buch of features of each property and price. 
    This dataset is unique at Listing_id level. 
2. Calendar is a dataset which has information at day level whether a property is available or occupied,
    and the price if available
3. Reviews has customer feedback and comments for each property along with date


In the notebook we will try to answer the below questions
1. How are property prices distributed in Seattle ?
2. Build a model to predict price based on important independent variables from the data
3. What are consumers talking about Airbnb Seattle


We built a linear regression model to predict price in this study with an R2 metric of 0.64
